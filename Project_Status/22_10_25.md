    - Transaction hash with copy button
    - Nullifier with copy button
    - Formatted timestamp
    - Digital signature
    - Download receipt button (üíæ)
    - Print receipt button (üñ®Ô∏è)
  - Created comprehensive test script (test-receipt-ui.js)
  - Successfully tested vote submission and receipt generation
  - Receipt displays correctly after vote submission

#### 2. Multiple Users Testing ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Complete
- **Time**: ~45 minutes
- **Details**:
  - Created test user 1: institution_id "12345"
  - Created test user 2: institution_id "54321"
  - Both users successfully voted in Election 4
  - Verified different nullifiers generated:
    - User 1: `4dc53511ecdacb0502bf28eaff2b97...`
    - User 2: `78bbfa908fe968062f2329d4f7e4fe...`
  - Verified different transaction hashes for each vote
  - Confirmed double-vote prevention works (HTTP 400 error)
  - Created test-multiple-users.js for automated testing

#### 3. RSA Election Keys Generation ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Complete
- **Time**: ~1 hour
- **Details**:
  - Created generate-election-keys.js script
  - Generated RSA-OAEP 2048-bit keypairs for all 4 elections
  - Private keys saved to `backend/keys/election_*_private.pem`
  - Public keys saved to `backend/keys/election_*_public.pem`
  - Public keys updated in elections table (451 characters each)
  - Tested encryption/decryption for all keypairs (all passed)
  - Added `keys/` and `*.pem` to .gitignore
  - **Security Notes**:
    - Private keys stored locally (NOT in version control)
    - Only public keys in database
    - Voters will use public keys to encrypt ballots
    - Only administrators can decrypt with private keys

#### 4. Full ECDSA Verification Implementation ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Complete
- **Time**: ~2 hours
- **Details**:
  - Installed `elliptic` library (npm package)

  - Added JWK format validation (kty, crv, x, y coordinates)
  - Added signature length validation (64 bytes for P-256)
  - Converts Web Crypto API signatures (IEEE P1363 format) to elliptic format
  - Verifies signatures using SHA-256 hash
  - Created test-ecdsa-verification.js for testing
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - Parses base64-encoded JWK public keys
    - Validates curve is P-256 (secp256r1)
    - Splits 64-byte signature into r and s components (32 bytes each)
    - Uses elliptic.verify() for cryptographic verification

#### 5. Rate Limiting ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Code Complete (testing pending backend restart)
- **Time**: ~1 hour
- **Details**:
  - Installed `express-rate-limit` package (already present)
  - Created middleware/rateLimiter.js with 4 limiters:
    - **registerLimiter**: 5 requests per 15 minutes
    - **loginLimiter**: 10 requests per 15 minutes
    - **voteLimiter**: 10 requests per 1 hour
    - **generalLimiter**: 100 requests per 15 minutes
  - Applied limiters to routes:
    - POST /api/users/register ‚Üí registerLimiter
    - POST /api/users/login ‚Üí loginLimiter
    - POST /api/elections/:id/vote ‚Üí voteLimiter
  - Returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when limit exceeded
  - Includes retryAfter timestamp in response
  - Uses in-memory store (for production, use Redis)
  - Created test-rate-limiting.js for automated testing

### üîÑ In Progress (1/6)

#### 6. Audit Logging ‚è≥
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Estimated Time**: 2 hours
- **Plan**:
  - Create audit_logs table migration
  - Implement logging utility (utils/auditLogger.js)
  - Log critical events:
    - Vote submissions (success/failure)
    - Signature verifications (pass/fail)
    - Double-vote attempts
    - Registration events
    - Login attempts
    - Rate limit violations
  - Include metadata: user_id, action, resource_type, resource_id, IP address, user agent
