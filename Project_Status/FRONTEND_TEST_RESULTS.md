**URL:** http://localhost:5173/elections/1/vote

**Test:** Vote for "Alice" in Election ID 1

**Expected Crypto Operations (Step-by-Step):**

#### Step 1: Generate Nullifier
```javascript
// SHA-256(ECDSA_PrivateKey + ElectionId)
nullifier = SHA256(ecdsaPrivateKey + "1")
```
- Expected output: 64 hex characters
- Should be deterministic (same input = same output)

#### Step 2: Encrypt Ballot
```javascript
// RSA-OAEP encryption with election public key
encryptedBallot = RSA_OAEP_Encrypt(
  plaintext: { candidateId: 1, timestamp: Date.now() },
  publicKey: electionPublicKey
)
```
- Expected output: Base64 or hex string
- Length: ~256 bytes (2048-bit RSA)

#### Step 3: Create Vote Package
```javascript
votePackage = {
  encryptedBallot: "...",
  nullifier: "...",
  electionId: 1,
  timestamp: 1730384000000
}
```

#### Step 4: Sign Vote Package
```javascript
// ECDSA signature with P-256
signature = ECDSA_Sign(
  data: JSON.stringify(votePackage),
  privateKey: ecdsaPrivateKey
)
```
- Expected output: 64 bytes (r + s values)
- Format: Hex or Base64

#### Step 5: Submit to Backend
```javascript
POST /api/elections/1/vote
{
  encryptedBallot: "...",
  nullifier: "...",
  electionId: 1,
  timestamp: 1730384000000,
  signature: "...",
  publicKey: ecdsaPublicKey
}
```

**Console Logs to Watch:**
- ✅ "Generating nullifier..."
- ✅ "Nullifier: [64 hex chars]"
- ✅ "Encrypting ballot..."
- ✅ "Ballot encrypted successfully"
- ✅ "Signing vote package..."
- ✅ "Signature generated: [signature]"
- ✅ "Submitting vote..."
- ✅ "Vote submitted successfully"

**Backend Processing:**
1. Verify ECDSA signature
2. Check nullifier not used before
3. Verify user is registered for election
4. Store encrypted vote
5. Create receipt
6. Log audit entry

**Expected Response:**
- HTTP 201 Created
- Receipt object with:
  - Receipt ID
  - Nullifier hash
  - Transaction hash (if blockchain)
  - Timestamp
  - Signature

**Performance Metrics:**
- Nullifier generation: [To be measured] ms
- Ballot encryption: [To be measured] ms
- Signature generation: [To be measured] ms
- Total client-side crypto: [To be measured] ms
- Server response time: [To be measured] ms

### Test 10: ECDSA Signature Verification (Backend)
**Status:** ⏳ **PENDING USER EXECUTION**  
**Test Method:** Backend logs and audit trail

**Verification Points:**

   - Or: "ECDSA signature verification: FAILED"

2. Check audit logs table:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
   WHERE event_type = 'SIGNATURE_VERIFIED' 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. Verify signature algorithm:
   - Algorithm: ECDSA
   - Curve: P-256
   - Hash: SHA-256
   - Format: Raw or DER

**Expected Backend Behavior:**
- Extract public key from request
- Reconstruct signed data (vote package)
- Verify signature matches
- Reject if signature invalid
- Log verification result

**Security Checks:**
- [ ] Invalid signature rejected (HTTP 401)

### Test 11: RSA Ballot Encryption Verification
**Status:** ⏳ **PENDING USER EXECUTION**  
**Test Method:** Network inspection and backend logs

**Verification Steps:**
1. Open Network tab in DevTools
2. Find POST request to /api/elections/:id/vote
3. Inspect request payload
4. Check `encryptedBallot` field:
   - Should NOT be readable plaintext
   - Should be Base64 or hex encoded
   - Length should be ~344 characters (256 bytes Base64)

**Security Validation:**
- [ ] Plaintext vote not visible in network traffic
- [ ] Encryption uses election's public key
- [ ] Different votes produce different ciphertexts
- [ ] Encrypted data changes with each vote (padding)

**Backend Decryption (Admin Only):**
- Only election private key holder can decrypt
- Decryption should reveal original vote
- Format preserved: { candidateId, timestamp }

**Observations:**
[To be filled during testing]

**Verdict:** [To be determined]

2. **Same User, Same Election (Attempt):**
   - Try to vote again
   - Should generate SAME nullifier
   - Backend should reject (duplicate nullifier)

3. **Different User, Same Election:**
   - Login as different user
   - Vote in same election
   - Should generate DIFFERENT nullifier

4. **Same User, Different Election:**
   - Vote in different election
   - Should generate DIFFERENT nullifier

**Database Check:**
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  election_id, 
  nullifier_hash, 
  created_at 
FROM votes_meta 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

**Properties to Verify:**
- [ ] Nullifier is deterministic (same user + election = same nullifier)
- [ ] Nullifier is unique per user-election pair
- [ ] Nullifier is unlinkable (can't derive user from nullifier)
- [ ] Nullifier is 64 hex characters (256 bits)
