## 🎯 Tomorrow's Plan (Monday, November 18, 2025)

### Phase 1: Foundation Security Testing (Morning - 30 min)

**Execute P0 Priority Tests:**
1. Run Scenario 1.1 - Byzantine Majority Takeover
   - Verify BFT consensus mechanism
   - Confirm Byzantine node detection
   
2. Run Scenario 3.1 - Signature Forgery
   - Verify ECDSA signature validation
   - Confirm forged signatures rejected
   
3. Run Scenario 3.3 - Double Voting Prevention
   - Verify nullifier system working
   - Confirm vote deduplication
   
4. Run Scenario 2.1 - Chain Fork Detection
   - Verify fork detection
   - Confirm network partition recovery

**Commands:**
```bash
cd security-testing-framework
bash test-security-orchestrator.sh scenario-1-1
bash test-security-orchestrator.sh scenario-3-1
bash test-security-orchestrator.sh scenario-3-3
bash test-security-orchestrator.sh scenario-2-1
```

**Deliverable:** P0 test results report

### Phase 2: Core Security Testing (Late Morning - 30 min)

**If P0 All Pass - Execute P1 Priority Tests:**
1. Run Scenario 1.2 - Equivocation (Double-Signing)
2. Run Scenario 1.3 - Omission (Message Withholding)
3. Run Scenario 4.1 - Ballot Modification (MITM)
4. Run Scenario 7.1 - SQL Injection Prevention

**Deliverable:** P1 test results report

### Phase 3: Results Analysis (Afternoon - 45 min)

**For Each Test:**
- Review JSON results in `results/` folder
- Check forensic data
- Document findings
- Note any failures or anomalies

**Create:**
- Summary document of test results
- List of any failed tests
- Preliminary security assessment

**Deliverable:** Test Results Summary Document

### Phase 4: Documentation Update (End of Day - 30 min)

**Update:**
- Project status with test results
- New findings or issues discovered
- Success/failure metrics
- Next steps based on results

**Create:**
- 18_11_25.md status update
- Test execution log
- Any remediation plans needed

**Deliverable:** Updated project status files

### Phase 5: Planning for Next Tests (Optional)

**If Time Permits:**
- Review P2 test scenarios
- Plan data integrity testing
- Prepare any needed fixtures or data
- Schedule P3 and P4 tests

## 💡 Notes

### What Worked Well Today
- Organized all security test files into dedicated folder
- Created comprehensive priority guide for test execution
- Clear documentation hierarchy established
- Git history clean and organized
- All systems operational and verified

### What To Focus On Tomorrow
- Execute P0 tests systematically
- Document all results thoroughly
- Identify any system issues
- Plan remediation if needed
- Keep accurate logs for audit trail

### Risks/Concerns
- ⚠️ If P0 tests fail: Critical system issues exist
- ⚠️ If high failure rate: May need significant fixes
- ⚠️ Execution time: Tests may take longer than estimated

### Mitigation
- Run tests one at a time for visibility
- Review forensic data for each failure
- Keep detailed logs
- Have backups of blockchain state

## 🎯 Bottom Line

### Completed Today
✅ Security testing framework fully organized and documented  
✅ Test priority guide created with clear execution path  
✅ All systems verified operational  
✅ Ready to begin security testing campaign  

### Starting Tomorrow
→ Execute P0 foundation tests (Byzantine, Crypto, Voting, Fork)  
→ Validate core security mechanisms  
→ Document results for audit trail  
→ Plan next phases based on results  

### Expected Outcome
By end of tomorrow: Clear picture of system security posture  
- Baseline security confidence established
- Any critical issues identified
- Path forward documented
