## 🔧 Helper Commands

### Check if servers are running:
```bash
# Backend
curl http://localhost:3000/api/elections

# Frontend
curl http://localhost:5174
```

### View latest vote:
```bash
cd /h/Voting/backend
node check-vote.js
```

### Create new test election:
```bash
cd /h/Voting/backend
node create-test-election.js
```

### Run automated tests:
```bash
cd /h/Voting/backend
node test-crypto-integration.js
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Keys not loaded"
- Logout and login again
- Check localStorage has 4 keys
- Try re-registering

### "User not registered for election"
```bash
cd /h/Voting/backend
node create-test-election.js
```

### "Cannot connect to backend"
- Check backend is running on port 3000
- Check backend terminal for errors
- Try restarting backend

### "Invalid signature" (this is OK)
- We're using simplified verification in dev mode
- Backend should still accept the vote
- Look for "⚠️ Using simplified signature verification"

## 🎉 What You're About to See

When you vote, the system will:

1. **Generate keys** (already done during registration)
2. **Encrypt your ballot** using the election's public key
3. **Sign the encrypted ballot** with your private key
4. **Generate a nullifier** to prevent double-voting
5. **Send everything to backend** as an encrypted package
6. **Backend verifies signature** without seeing your vote
7. **Backend stores encrypted ballot** (can't read it)
8. **Return a receipt** proving you voted

**The server CANNOT see who you voted for!** 🔒  
**But it CAN verify your vote is legitimate!** ✅  
**And it CAN prevent you from voting twice!** 🚫

---
