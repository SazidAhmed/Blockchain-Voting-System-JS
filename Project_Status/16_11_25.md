Although all phases have been **designed and documented**, the test scripts have not yet been **executed** against the actual system. This comprehensive testing plan ensures:
- All 73 tests execute successfully
- Performance metrics are validated in real-time
- Edge cases are discovered and documented
- System is truly production-ready
- Documentation reflects actual behavior

docker-compose ps
# Expected: All 5 blockchain nodes RUNNING
# Expected: Any supporting services RUNNING
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✓ All containers in "Up" state
- ✓ No containers in "Exit" or "Error" state
- ✓ docker-compose ps shows healthy status

**Step 3: Initial Health Check** (5 minutes)

# Run just that test again
bash test-phase-X-task-Y.sh
```

**Step 2: Check Logs**
```bash
# View detailed logs
docker-compose logs blockchain-node-1 | tail -100
```

**Step 3: Assess Severity**
- Critical (data loss risk): Stop testing, restore backup
- High (feature broken): Fix and retest
- Low (timing issue): Note and continue

**Step 4: Recovery Options**
```bash
# Option 1: Restart system
docker-compose restart

# Option 2: Restore from backup
./docker-restore.sh

# Option 3: Clean start
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```
