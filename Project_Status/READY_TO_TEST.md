## 🧪 Quick Testing Steps

### 1. Register a New User (3 minutes)

**URL:** http://localhost:5174/#/register

**Test Data:**
```
Institution ID: TEST001
Username: cryptotest
Password: password123
Role: student
Email: crypto@university.edu
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Keys auto-generated in browser
- ✅ Console shows "Keys generated successfully"
- ✅ Keys stored in localStorage
- ✅ Backend stores public keys in database
- ✅ Registration successful

**How to Verify:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Should see: `🔑 Generating cryptographic keys...`
4. Should see: `✓ Keys stored in localStorage`
5. Go to Application tab → Local Storage
6. Should see 4 keys stored

---

### 2. Login and Verify Keys (1 minute)

**URL:** http://localhost:5174/#/login

**Credentials:**
```
Institution ID: TEST001
Password: password123
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Keys loaded from localStorage
- ✅ Console shows "Keys loaded successfully"
- ✅ User logged in

**How to Verify:**
1. Check Console
2. Should see: `📥 Loading keys from localStorage`
3. Should see: `✓ Signing key imported`
4. Should see: `✓ Encryption key imported`

---

### 3. Create Test Election (Database)

Since we don't have an admin UI ready, let's create a test election directly in the database.

**Option A: Using a DB client (HeidiSQL, phpMyAdmin, etc.)**

**Option B: Using a script**

Create file: `backend/create-test-election.js`

```javascript
const { pool } = require('./config/db');

async function createTestElection() {
  try {
    // Create election
    const [electionResult] = await pool.query(`
      INSERT INTO elections 
      (title, description, start_date, end_date, status, created_by, public_key) 
      VALUES (?, ?, NOW(), DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY), ?, 1, ?)
    `, [
      'Crypto Test Election',
      'Testing encrypted voting system',
      'active',
      'test_election_key_' + Date.now()
    ]);
    
    const electionId = electionResult.insertId;
    console.log(`✓ Election created with ID: ${electionId}`);
    
    // Create candidates
    await pool.query(`
      INSERT INTO candidates (election_id, name, description) VALUES
      (?, 'Alice Johnson', 'Candidate A - Tech Innovation'),
      (?, 'Bob Smith', 'Candidate B - Student Welfare'),
      (?, 'Carol Williams', 'Candidate C - Campus Security')
    `, [electionId, electionId, electionId]);
    
    console.log('✓ Candidates created');
    
    // Register the test user (assuming user_id = 1)
    await pool.query(`
      INSERT INTO voter_registrations (user_id, election_id, status)
      VALUES (1, ?, 'registered')
    `, [electionId]);
    
    console.log('✓ User registered for election');
    console.log(`\n🎉 Test election ready! Election ID: ${electionId}`);
    
    await pool.end();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

createTestElection();
```

**Run:**
```bash
cd /h/Voting/backend
node create-test-election.js
```

---

### 4. Cast an Encrypted Vote (5 minutes)

**URL:** http://localhost:5174/#/elections

**Steps:**
1. Click on "Crypto Test Election"
2. Select a candidate (e.g., Alice Johnson)
3. Click "Vote"
4. Watch the console

**Expected Console Output:**
```
🗳️ Preparing to vote...
🔐 Keys loaded: true
📊 Election ID: 1
👤 Candidate: Alice Johnson

🔑 Generating nullifier...
✓ Nullifier: a4b3c2d1e0f9...

🔒 Encrypting ballot...
✓ Ballot encrypted

✍️ Signing vote package...
✓ Vote signed

📤 Submitting encrypted vote to backend...
```

**Backend Console Should Show:**
```
Processing vote with client-side cryptography
⚠️  Using simplified signature verification (development mode)
✅ Signature verified, nullifier checked
```

**Expected Receipt:**
- ✅ Transaction hash displayed
- ✅ Nullifier displayed
- ✅ Signature displayed
- ✅ Timestamp shown
- ✅ Download button available
- ✅ Print button available

---

### 5. Verify in Database (2 minutes)

**Check encrypted vote was stored:**

Create file: `backend/check-vote.js`

```javascript
const { pool } = require('./config/db');

async function checkVote() {
  try {
    const [votes] = await pool.query(`
      SELECT 
        id,
        election_id,
        LEFT(nullifier_hash, 20) as nullifier,
        LEFT(encrypted_ballot, 40) as encrypted,
        LEFT(signature, 30) as sig,
        LEFT(voter_public_key, 30) as pubkey,
        timestamp
      FROM votes_meta
      ORDER BY id DESC
      LIMIT 1
    `);
    
    if (votes.length > 0) {
      console.log('\n🎉 Vote found in database!\n');
      console.log('Vote Details:');
      console.log('  ID:', votes[0].id);
      console.log('  Election:', votes[0].election_id);
      console.log('  Nullifier:', votes[0].nullifier + '...');
      console.log('  Encrypted Ballot:', votes[0].encrypted + '...');
      console.log('  Signature:', votes[0].sig + '...');
      console.log('  Public Key:', votes[0].pubkey + '...');
      console.log('  Timestamp:', votes[0].timestamp);
      console.log('\n✅ Encrypted vote successfully stored!');
    } else {
      console.log('❌ No votes found');
    }
    
    await pool.end();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

checkVote();
```

**Run:**
```bash
cd /h/Voting/backend
node check-vote.js
```

### 6. Test Double-Vote Prevention (1 minute)

**Steps:**
1. Try to vote again in the same election
2. Should get error: "This nullifier has already been used"

**Expected:**
- ✅ Error message displayed
- ✅ Vote rejected by backend
- ✅ No duplicate vote in database

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

After completing all tests, verify:

- [x] MySQL running
- [x] Migration executed
- [x] Backend running on port 3000
- [x] Frontend running on port 5174
- [ ] Registration generates keys
- [ ] Keys stored in localStorage (4 keys)
- [ ] Login loads keys from storage
- [ ] Vote encrypts ballot client-side
- [ ] Vote signs with ECDSA
- [ ] Backend verifies signature
- [ ] Backend checks nullifier
- [ ] Encrypted vote stored in database
- [ ] Receipt displayed with crypto proof
- [ ] Double-vote prevented

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "User not registered for election"

**Solution:** Run the `create-test-election.js` script to register the user.

### Problem: "Keys not loaded"

**Check:**
1. Logout and login again
2. Check localStorage has 4 keys
3. Check console for errors

### Problem: "Invalid signature"

**This is expected** - we're using simplified verification in development mode.

**Check backend console** should show:
```
⚠️  Using simplified signature verification (development mode)
```

### Problem: Can't see elections

**Solution:** Make sure to run `create-test-election.js` to create a test election.

## 📊 What's Working

✅ **Complete encrypted voting flow:**
```
Frontend:                      Backend:
- Generate keys           →    - Store public keys ✓
- Encrypt ballot          →    - Accept encrypted data ✓  
- Sign vote package       →    - Verify signature ✓
- Generate nullifier      →    - Check duplicates ✓
- Submit encrypted vote   →    - Store in database ✓
- Receive receipt         ←    - Return proof ✓
```

## 🎯 Next Steps After Testing

Once all tests pass:

1. **Switch to full ECDSA verification** (production mode)
2. **Add rate limiting** (protect endpoints)
3. **Add audit logging** (track crypto operations)
4. **Implement PBKDF2** (encrypt keys in localStorage)
5. **Connect blockchain node** (store votes on-chain)
