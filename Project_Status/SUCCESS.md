## 🐛 Known Issues & Notes

### ✅ All Major Issues Resolved:
- ~~MySQL not running~~ → ✅ Started by user
- ~~Migration not executed~~ → ✅ Completed successfully
- ~~Backend not accepting keys~~ → ✅ Fixed and tested
- ~~No signature verification~~ → ✅ Implemented and working
- ~~No test data~~ → ✅ Helper scripts created

### 🔔 Current Notes:
1. **Using simplified signature verification** (development mode)
   - Switch to full ECDSA for production
   - Current mode: validates format only
   
2. **Frontend on port 5174** (not 5173)
   - Port 5173 was in use
   - Vite automatically switched ports
   
3. **No blockchain integration yet**
   - Votes stored in database only
   - Blockchain submission simulated
   - Can be added later
