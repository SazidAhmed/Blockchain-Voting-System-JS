Current Limitations:

‚ö†Ô∏è Receipt UI not verified (vote works, but display uncertain)
‚ö†Ô∏è Using Base64-encoded JSON fallback (election keys are placeholders, not real RSA keys)
‚ö†Ô∏è Simplified signature verification (dev mode, not full ECDSA)
‚ö†Ô∏è No blockchain node (bypassed with simulated transaction hashes)
‚ö†Ô∏è vote_receipts table disabled (schema mismatch)
‚ö†Ô∏è No rate limiting or comprehensive audit logging
Today's Plan (October 22) üìÖ
Immediate Priorities:

‚úÖ Verify receipt UI (15 min)
‚úÖ Test multiple users (30 min)
‚úÖ Generate proper RSA election keys (1-2 hours)
‚úÖ Implement full ECDSA verification (2-3 hours)
‚úÖ Fix vote_receipts table (30 min)
This Week:

Rate limiting on endpoints
Audit logging for crypto operations
PBKDF2 key encryption for localStorage
Input validation
Goal: 70% project completion (currently 60%)
