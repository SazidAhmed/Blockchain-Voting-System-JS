# OR
npm restart
```

### 3. Test in Frontend
- Open Admin Dashboard
- Click "🔐 Audit Logs" tab
- Should see log entries for past actions

## 🔐 Core Features

### 1. Mutation Locking
```
Election Status    Candidate Actions
─────────────────  ────────────────
PENDING            ✅ Add/Delete allowed
ACTIVE             ❌ Add/Delete blocked
COMPLETED          ❌ Add/Delete blocked
```

### 2. Audit Logging
Every action logged with:
- ✅ Admin ID (who)
- ✅ Action type (what)
- ✅ Changes (changes)
- ✅ IP address (where)
- ✅ Timestamp (when)
- ✅ Hash signature (proof)

### 3. Security Events
Logged with severity:
- 🔵 LOW: Informational
- 🟡 MEDIUM: Important
- 🔴 HIGH: Unusual activity
- ⚫ CRITICAL: Violations

## 🧪 Quick Test

### Test 1: Create & Log
```
1. Admin Dashboard → Create Election
2. Fill details and submit
3. Go to Audit Logs tab
4. Should see CREATE_ELECTION entry
```

### Test 2: Mutation Lock
```
1. Activate election (set status to "active")
2. Try to add candidate
3. Should get error: "Cannot add candidate"
4. Check Audit Logs for failed attempt
```

### Test 3: Verify Integrity
```
1. Audit Logs tab
2. Click "Verify" on any log
3. Should show "✓ Hash matches"
```

## 📊 Admin Audit Logs Tab

**Filters:**
- Action Type: CREATE_ELECTION, ADD_CANDIDATE, DELETE_CANDIDATE, etc.
- Status: Success or Failed

**Actions:**
- Verify: Check hash integrity
- Pagination: Browse through logs
- Filter: Find specific events

## 🔗 API Endpoints

### Get Audit Logs
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/audit-logs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

### Get Security Logs
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/security-logs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

### Verify Log Integrity
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/verify-audit-integrity/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

### Add Candidate (Protected)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/elections/1/candidates \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "John Doe", "description": "Candidate"}'
```

Will return 403 if election is locked/active.

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### Issue: Audit Logs tab not showing
**Fix:** 
```bash
# Hard refresh browser
Ctrl+Shift+R

# Or rebuild frontend
cd frontend && npm run build
```

### Issue: Cannot add candidate - but election not active
**Fix:**
- Check election `is_locked` column in database
- Verify election status is "pending"
- Check database: `SELECT is_locked, status FROM elections WHERE id=1;`

### Issue: No logs appearing
**Fix:**
```bash
# Check migration ran
mysql -u root -p voting -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE 'admin%';"

# Should show:
# admin_audit_logs
# admin_security_logs
```

### Issue: Hash verification fails
**Fix:**
- Ensure no modifications to audit log in database
- Verify hash algorithm is SHA256
- Check changes JSON is valid

## 📈 Monitoring

### Weekly Check
1. Review audit logs
2. Look for HIGH/CRITICAL events
3. Check for unusual IP addresses
4. Verify no failed mutations

### Database Health
```sql
-- Check table sizes
SELECT 
  'admin_audit_logs' as table_name,
  ROUND((data_length+index_length)/1024/1024, 2) as size_mb
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('admin_audit_logs', 'admin_security_logs');

-- Count recent entries
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM admin_audit_logs WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURDATE();
```

## 🔄 Workflow

### Creating Election
```
1. Admin fills election form
2. Clicks "Create Election"
3. System:
   - Creates election (is_locked=false)
   - Creates candidates
   - Logs CREATE_ELECTION to audit_logs
   - Logs security event
   - Returns success
4. Admin sees log entry in Audit Logs tab
```

### Activating Election
```
1. Admin selects election
2. Clicks "Activate"
3. System:
   - Changes status to "active"
   - Sets is_locked=true
   - Locks all candidates
   - Logs security event
4. Mutation attempts now return 403
```

### Adding Candidate (After Activation)
```
1. Admin tries to add candidate
2. System checks:
   - Is election locked? YES
   - Return 403 error
3. Logs failed attempt + HIGH security event
4. Admin sees error message
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Migration executed successfully
- [ ] admin_audit_logs table exists
- [ ] admin_security_logs table exists
- [ ] elections table has is_locked column
- [ ] Audit Logs tab visible in AdminDashboard
- [ ] Can create election and see audit log
- [ ] Cannot add candidate after election activation

## 🎯 Success Indicators

System is working when:
- ✅ Audit logs appear immediately after actions
- ✅ Failed mutations return 403 and log event
- ✅ Hash verification shows "integrity verified"
- ✅ Security events have correct severity
- ✅ Frontend displays all details correctly
- ✅ No errors in logs or console

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### If Mutation Lock Broken
```sql
-- Manual unlock (emergency only)
UPDATE elections SET is_locked=0 WHERE id=1;
-- Then restart backend
```

### If Logs Not Creating
```bash
# Check adminLogger initialized
grep -n "new AdminAuditLogger" backend/routes/elections.js

# Verify database connection
mysql -u root -p voting -e "SELECT 1;" 

# Check backend logs
docker logs voting-backend
```

### If Migration Failed
```bash
# Check error message
mysql -u root -p voting -e "DESCRIBE admin_audit_logs;" 

# If table exists, migration already ran
# If table doesn't exist, run migration again
node backend/migrations/002_add_admin_audit_logging.js
```

## 📞 Support Resources

### Quick Commands
