# Phase 5 Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 30-Second Setup

```bash
# Start the network (from root directory)
bash docker-start.sh

# Run all Phase 5 tests
bash test-phase5-all.sh

# Monitor recovery status
curl http://localhost:3001/recovery/status | jq
```

## 📋 What's New in Phase 5

### New Files Created
- `blockchain-node/recoveryManager.js` - Recovery coordination module
- `blockchain-node/byzantineValidator.js` - Byzantine fault tolerance validator
- `test-phase5-task5-1.sh` - Network recovery tests
- `test-phase5-task5-2.sh` - Byzantine fault tolerance tests
- `test-phase5-task5-3.sh` - Disaster recovery tests
- `test-phase5-all.sh` - Master test runner

### New Capabilities
✅ Network recovery after attacks  
✅ Byzantine fault tolerance validation  
✅ Disaster recovery procedures  
✅ State synchronization  
✅ Consensus restoration

## ⚡ Quick Commands

### Run Tests
```bash
# All Phase 5 tests (18 tests)
bash test-phase5-all.sh

# Individual task tests
bash test-phase5-task5-1.sh    # Network recovery
bash test-phase5-task5-2.sh    # Byzantine FT
bash test-phase5-task5-3.sh    # Disaster recovery
```

### Check Recovery Status
```bash
# Recovery progress
curl http://localhost:3001/recovery/status | jq

# Byzantine FT status
curl http://localhost:3001/bft/status | jq

# Recovery metrics
curl http://localhost:3001/recovery/metrics | jq

# Recovery report
curl http://localhost:3001/recovery/report | jq
```

### Test Individual Scenarios
```bash
# Simulate attack and recovery
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/security/quarantine \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"peerId":"peer1"}'

# Release quarantined peer
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/security/release \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"peerId":"peer1"}'

# Test disaster recovery
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/disaster/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scope":"full_failure"}'
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Tests failing to connect?**
```bash
# Check if all 5 nodes are running
docker ps | grep voting

# Start network
bash docker-start.sh

# Wait for initialization
sleep 30

# Try tests again
bash test-phase5-all.sh
```

**Recovery not responding?**
```bash
# Check node health
curl http://localhost:3001/health | jq

# Verify recovery module loaded
docker logs voting-node1 | grep -i recovery
```

**Byzantine tests timing out?**
```bash
# Check node performance
curl http://localhost:3001/metrics | jq

# May need to increase timeout if system is slow
# Modify test timeout in test-phase5-task5-2.sh
```
