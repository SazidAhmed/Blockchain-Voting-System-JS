SECURITY NOTICE:

This software is currently in development (60% complete) and is NOT ready for
production use in real elections. The following security measures are incomplete:

- Simplified signature verification (development mode)
- localStorage key storage without PBKDF2/AES-GCM encryption
- Placeholder election keys (not production RSA keys)
- No comprehensive security audit
- No penetration testing
- No formal cryptographic review

DO NOT use this software for actual elections without:
1. Complete security audit by qualified cryptography experts
2. Full implementation of all security features
3. Comprehensive penetration testing
4. Legal review and compliance verification
5. Proper key management infrastructure

The authors and contributors assume NO LIABILITY for any misuse, security
breaches, or election integrity issues arising from premature deployment.
